# Remote Unlock

Remote Unlock code for ESP-32

It contains several C++ template abstractions simplifying the use of ESP-32 library functions, most of these are either work in progress and/or untested.

## Abstractions

- BLE : Not really an abstraction at this point (2025-01-23)
- GPIO : Self explanatory
- Storage (and StorageItem) : Abstraction around NVS
